# 🛰️ Security Posture Evaluation  

## 📘 Case Study: Nebula Health Systems  

---

### 🩺 **Company Overview**

**Nebula Health Systems (NHS)** is a telemedicine startup headquartered in **Lagos, Nigeria**, with satellite offices in **Accra** and **London**.  

The company provides:
- **Remote consultations** with licensed doctors.
- **AI-powered symptom checks**.
- **Digital prescription services** across three regions.  

With **over 250,000 users** and **4 TB of patient health data** processed monthly, Nebula’s rapid growth introduced critical **security, privacy, and compliance challenges**.

In Q1 2025, the board mandated a **Controls and Compliance Assessment** before scaling operations and seeking **ISO 27001 certification**.

---

## 🎯 **Assessment Objectives**

The **goal** was to evaluate Nebula’s governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) posture using industry frameworks:

| Framework | Focus Area |
|------------|-------------|
| **ISO 27001** | Information Security Management System (ISMS) |
| **HIPAA** | Healthcare data protection |
| **NIST CSF** | Cybersecurity control maturity |
| **GDPR** | Cross-border data privacy |

---

## 🧭 **Audit Scope**

| Domain | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Infrastructure** | AWS Cloud (EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda) |
| **Applications** | Nebula App (Mobile + Web), Doctor Portal, Admin Console |
| **Data Types** | PII, PHI, financial info, system logs |
| **Access Control** | RBAC implemented but inconsistent MFA usage |
| **Incident Management** | Manual via Slack – no formal policy |
| **Physical Security** | Lagos HQ with biometric entry & 24/7 surveillance |

---

## ⚙️ **Technical Stats**

| Metric | Value | Observation |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Cloud Instances** | 62 EC2 nodes | 18 exposed to public IPs unnecessarily |
| **Data Volume** | 4.1 TB | Unencrypted S3 buckets in dev environment |
| **Access Roles** | 187 IAM roles | 63 dormant or inactive |
| **Average Downtime** | 2.4 hours/month | No failover redundancy |
| **Security Incidents (last 12 months)** | 7 | None formally documented |
| **Encryption Coverage** | 47% | Data in transit over HTTP in staging |
| **Patching Cadence** | Irregular | 29% of servers outdated by >90 days |

---

## ⚠️ **Risk Assessment**

**Top 5 Risks Identified**

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level (1–10) |
|----------|------------------|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| R-001 | Unencrypted PHI during transmission | High | Critical | **9.5** |
| R-002 | Overprivileged IAM roles | High | High | **8.0** |
| R-003 | Absence of incident response plan | High | Critical | **9.0** |
| R-004 | Public S3 buckets | Medium | High | **7.5** |
| R-005 | Lack of vendor compliance agreements | Medium | Medium | **6.0** |

🧮 **Average Risk Score:** **8.0/10 (High Risk)**  

Without stronger controls, Nebula faces potential regulatory penalties up to **$250,000 (HIPAA)** and **€20 million (GDPR)** for data mishandling.

## 🧩 **Control Assessment Summary**

| Control Category | Implementation | Finding Summary |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Access Control** | ❌ Poor | No MFA enforcement; 30+ dormant admin accounts |
| **Encryption** | ⚠️ Partial | TLS not forced in staging; AES-256 missing for S3 |
| **Incident Response** | ❌ Absent | No IR policy, no roles, no testing |
| **Vulnerability Mgmt.** | ⚠️ Inconsistent | No scanning tool; patching based on developer memory |
| **Monitoring & Logging** | ✅ Good | CloudTrail and GuardDuty active, but alerts unreviewed |
| **Backup & Recovery** | ✅ Good | Daily snapshots, but recovery never tested |
| **Change Management** | ❌ Poor | No approval workflow; developers deploy directly to prod |
| **Awareness & Training** | ⚠️ Limited | Verbal onboarding, no recurring awareness program |

---

## 📋 **Compliance Snapshot**

### **ISO 27001**
- ❌ ISMS not yet formalized  
- ❌ Asset register incomplete  
- ⚠️ Risk treatment plan drafted but not approved  

### **HIPAA**
- ❌ No encryption at rest for PHI  
- ❌ No signed Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)  
- ⚠️ Access logs incomplete  

### **GDPR**
- ⚠️ Privacy policy lacks retention clause  
- ❌ No Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)  
- ✅ Data subject requests handled manually  

### **NIST CSF Function Scores**

| Function | Score (0–5) | Maturity Level |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Identify | 2.5 | Developing |
| Protect | 2.0 | Developing |
| Detect | 3.0 | Managed |
| Respond | 1.0 | Initial |
| Recover | 2.5 | Developing |

📊 **Average Maturity Score:** **2.2/5 — Developing (Immature GRC Program)**

---

## 💡 **Recommendations**

### 🔐 Short-Term (0–3 Months)
1. Enforce **MFA for all accounts** (AWS, GitHub, Okta).
2. Encrypt all PHI at rest and in transit.
3. Lock down all **public S3 buckets** and audit permissions.
4. Remove **dormant IAM users** and implement least privilege.

### 🧠 Mid-Term (3–6 Months)
1. Deploy **vulnerability management system** (Tenable or OpenVAS).
2. Create and test a formal **Incident Response Plan**.
3. Establish a **Change Management Policy** and approval flow.
4. Conduct **company-wide security awareness training**.

### 🏗️ Long-Term (6–12 Months)
1. Build a formal **ISMS** aligned with **ISO 27001**.
2. Appoint a **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** for GDPR compliance.
3. Conduct **bi-annual penetration testing**.
4. Pursue **SOC 2 Type I** certification to strengthen investor trust.

## 🧠 Summary

The controls and compliance assessment for **Nebula Health Systems (NHS)** revealed a classic case of rapid digital growth outpacing cybersecurity maturity. As the organization expanded its telemedicine platform across multiple regions, the lack of unified governance, standardized controls, and proactive monitoring introduced significant vulnerabilities, particularly around **data privacy, access management, and incident response**.

The **risk profile (8.0/10)** placed NHS in the *high-risk zone*, mainly due to:
- Unencrypted Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Overprivileged IAM roles
- Lack of incident response and disaster recovery procedures
- Outdated systems with manual patch cycles

These weaknesses directly jeopardized compliance with **HIPAA** and **GDPR**, both of which impose heavy fines and reputational damage for mishandling personal health data.

By applying the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** as the audit backbone, NHS could methodically align its technical, administrative, and physical controls.  

The organization’s journey highlights three key lessons:
1. **Visibility is the foundation of control.** You can’t protect what you don’t know exists.  
2. **Compliance does not equal security.** True resilience requires a culture of accountability and continuous improvement.  
3. **Metrics drive credibility.** Quantifiable risk reduction and audit readiness translate directly into operational and financial gains.
 
Their next steps include pursuing full **ISO 27001 certification**, automating patch management, and integrating **AI-driven threat detection** to maintain long-term resilience in a fast-evolving healthcare landscape.
